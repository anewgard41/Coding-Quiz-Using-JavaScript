We have now entered into the wild world of APIs! This project had us use everything we added to our toolbox this week. We dynamically rendered HTML elements and populated them using various methods and APIs. Several elements of HTML and CSS were dynamically rendered including divs, ordered lists, text content, buttons, text coloring, etc. 

Timer functionality was integrated using interval related APIs. Eventlisteners were used to give functionality to the buttons/answer choices. 

Finally, we locally stored initials and score values using JSON parsing and stringify! 

Thanks so much for reading, and hope you enjoy. Cheers!
